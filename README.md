Worldwide Ramen Map is a mobile iOS application to search Ramen shops with the map. Users can also create a request to add new Ramen shop to this app. The info of this app will be created by users!

# Why I created this app
One of my hobbies is going to Ramen shops where I have never visit. Moreover I wanted to create a iOS app with GoogleMap and Firebase. This is why I decided to create this app. I'm glad if this app is useful for Ramen-Manias all over the world!
